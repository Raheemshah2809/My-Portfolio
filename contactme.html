Hi and welcome to my Portfolio, this is where all of my projects and skills will be shown here, Im a 19 year old software engineer and I started from scratch for example I didn't know a single programming language or know anything about programming, I took software engineering at university to learn something new  and I love being about computers. My end goal is to found a business from scratch which has something todo with AI to help people in the future. One of the skills I had learned was making this website from scratch, I used HTML and CSS with some Javascript, everyday I am studying and learning and developing on languages.

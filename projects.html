<p class="Ps">
Welcome all to my first Post, This Rom Was tested by me, the rom tested was called Project Sakura, and it was running on Android 10, and it was built off of Lineage os 17. 
During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:
<ol class="pslist">
<li>Battery Life</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Benchmarking Score</li>
<li>Daily Experience</li>
<li>Features</li>
</ol>
<br>

Battery Life, <br>
I had used this Rom as my daily driver, this would mean I would be constantly on the phone, I would be browsing the internet, Be on social media such as Instagram and snapchat and reddit, I will also watch Youtube videos and Game. Some of these game were BrawlStars and PUBG. I started my battery life on 100% and I wouldn't charge my phone until it got to 3%. After I had conducted the test, the results were surprising. These were the results. 
Here is a link for the photos.

</ol>
</p>
<p class="Ps">
As you can see the custom rom would be get me around 4 Hours and 35 Minutes of Screen on time, This I would say is pretty good the phone is around 3 years old and getting a full day of usage is incredible, Great work to the developers.

Performance,<br>
Performance with this rom is superb, It is fast, fluid and can handle multiple apps running at the same time. To find out the Performance of the rom I had used an application called Geekbench 5 and ran the test. The results were actually good. because I thought going into the test that I would get a lower score. these are the photos.

<li class="Pslist2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JnJIjQ3.jpg">Overall Core Score</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="Ps">
As you can See these score are good, They beat the average score of the device, I had also ran a few games, some were demanding such as PUBG, I am glad to report that the game was running smooth and the setting were on high and set to smooth, The device did heat up a little but was okay to play with. I then tested a game called BrawlStars this game was smooth to run and there wasn't really any battery drain as I saw with PUBG, this probably because it was a less demanding game. Overall this was a powerful rom and was great to game on, especially if your into gaming on your phone.

UI, <br>
This rom is running on android 10 so it has all the latest features from google, it also has its own features but in by the developers, here are a few setting they have added. (see link below)
<br>
<ol>
<li class="Pslist2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZrHpENq.jpg">Sakura Configs</a></li>
<li class="Pslist2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qm9rhak.png">Quick Setting Tiles Configs</a></li>
<li class="Pslist2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Xrpp5Gq.jpg">Lineages Own Customizations</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="Ps">
As you can see there are quite a few Customization features packed into the Rom, this great if you like to Customize your rom. You can also Install Magisk and I managed to pass both cts and integrity, so I can use Google pay. Also the it is using Lawnchair Launcher instead of Lineages own one, this is great because you can add icon packs, and change icon size and grid size, which in my opinion is great. 
</p>

<p class="Ps">
Conclusion,<br>
Overall this is great rom for someone who wants to stay with Lineages os and they also want more customization option, this rom is power and can handle gaming, Battery life is impressive would get me around 4h 35m SOT, this would easily last me a full day, and another option I like about the rom, It has OTA updates which is the best because you don't have to re-flash the rom and wipe your device. This makes this rom one of the best Android 10 roms I have tested.

    Welcome all to my first Post, This Rom Was tested by me, the rom tested was called Project Sakura, and it was running on Android 10, and it was built off of Lineage os 17. 
    During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:
    <ol class="pslist">
    <li>Battery Life</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>UI</li>
    <li>Benchmarking Score</li>
    <li>Daily Experiance</li>
    <li>Features</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p class="Ps">
    Battery Life, <br>
    I had used this Rom as my daily driver, this would mean I would be constanly on the phone, I would be browsing the internet, Be on social media such as Instagram and snapchat and reddit, I will also watch Youtube videos and Game. Some of these game were BrawlStars and PUBG. I started my battery life on 100% and I wouldn't charge my phone until it got to 3%. After I had conducted the test, the results were surprising. These were the results.

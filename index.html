Hi and welcome to my Portfolio, This is where all of my projects and past works will be displayed. I'm currently a 19-year-old software engineer who started with no knowledge of programming at all, I wanted to learn more about how programmes and applications are made so I can one day make my own. My end goal is to start-up a business which will help people in the future from making lives easier to going full autonomous.

Welcome all to the review of Alpha UX Rom.  This Rom Was tested by me. And it is running on Android 9, with one UI version 1.0 but it does say 1.5, this may be edited. During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:

Battery Life, <br>
I had used this rom as a daily driver for around 2 weeks and so far I was impressed with battery life I would easily get around 4hr SOT (the images show only 3h 35m but these were higher depending on what you would do and if you tweaked any settings) when gaming battery would not drop not as much as compared to other roms. This rom is optimized. bearing in-mind this is the first version of the rom. Here is a image of the battery usage i had screen-shotted.

<p class="Ps">
As you can it shows around 3h 35m of SOT, this can be higher depending on what you do and what you use it for. I could easily get over 4-5 hours SOT on some days this was with minimal gaming but mainly browsing the internet and social media. another feature which helps out with this rom is that everything is jet-black in other terms Amoled which is the best for battery life and dark mode. So far this is shaping out to be a good rom.

Performance,<br>
Performance with this rom is amazing, Its smooth and fluid with no bloatware. the rom claims to give you the best Performance and stability, and I think they have achieved their aim. I ran geekbench 5 test and the results where really good bearing in mind that this rom comes with a stock kernel, imagine it with a custom kernel such as NX there would be alot more power and battery life. For the single core score I had got a score of 390 which is very good, a stock s8+ with no custom rom or kernel would've got a score of 357. And for the multi core score of 1500 where as the stock s8+ would've got a score of 1396, and I can say you can tell a difference. The rom is very fluid and stable. Here are the scores for the rom.

<p class="Ps">
I ran a few games on this rom and all the games I ran fine with no lag or stutter, the games were Brawl stars, Clash of clans and PUBG with many more smaller titles.

UI, <br>
This rom was running on Android 9 and ONE UI version 1.5, there are a couple of customization features such as allowing the home screen and the app screen to go up to a 8x8 grid. this is useful if you want to have your icons small without using a launcher, there aren't much but thats because the whole point of the rom is to be as light and powerful as much as possible so you can great battery life. here is the full list of all the features you find in the rom.

Conclusion,<br>
Overall this is great rom for power and stability, This provides alot of battery life and Performance, Although not a ton of customization options but thats the price you must take if you want to have true power and battery life. this is the first version of the rom and the second release is due around july or september, hopefully we will see more changes then. as for bugs there aren't any I have encountered any, and VOLTE works this is a big thumbs up from me. Download this rom if you want true power, Performance and great battery life and you aren't too fussed about customization options not being available. Here is a link to the XDA page for the rom. this will give you all of the information on the rom, they also have a telegram channel for support.

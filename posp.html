Welcome all to the review of Posp Rom. This Rom Was tested by me. And it is running on Android 10. On my S8+ with the kernal provided with the rom.  During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:
<ol class="pslist">
<li>Battery Life</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Benchmarking Score</li>
<li>Daily Experience</li>
<li>Features</li>
</ol>

Battery Life, <br>
I had used this rom for around 2 weeks and Battery life was average, I would get around 4hr to 5hr SOT but while the screen was off there was little to none battery drain, This makes it one of the best features of the rom. Here below you can screenshots of both battery usage and the SOT.

</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="Ps">
As you can see it shows a SOT of 5h 35m which is very good especially when using it all day this was without ever charging the device, It also shows the last time it was charged was 20 hours ago, This is remarkable that the device and the rom put together gives your strong idle time for a device which is over 2 years old now. So if your the type of person who uses there phone not as much and doesn't really play any games but mainly browsing such as reddit and instagram, this rom will be very good for you.

Performance,<br>
I had used this Rom for a 2 weeks and It was smooth and buttery smooth at times there were some stutter and lags when exiting an app. this was fixed when closing all apps from recent menu.
Surprisingly when taking a Geekbench 5 score, the scores were very good, The highest I have ever seen so far. below are the score I got.  
Performance with this rom is amazing, Its smooth and fluid with no bloatware. the roms aim is and I quote "We aim to deliver an experience with original ideas and features along with the useful things the community is accustomed to you." and I think they have achieved their aim. Below are the score I got from Geekbench 5.

<p class="Ps">
I ran a few games on this rom and all the games I ran fine with no lag or stutter, the games were Brawl stars, Clash of clans and PUBG with many more smaller titles. Although there were some reports of lagging when playing games, this is where I advise you to do a clean install all the time especially when coming from another rom.

UI, <br>
The rom was running on android 10 and it built on AOSP, But there are a ton of customization features put in place, (This is an application called Fries which can be found pre-installed on your device) One of the main features which is huge standout coming from a rooted device is the ability to have over the air updates, this is a huge win so you don't have to reboot into twrp and re-flash yourself and lose your data again because you did a clean install. Another feature which makes the rom better than others is the customization app they include,(as stated above) this application gives your everything to customize, from  the quick settings to lock screen, themes gestures and statusbar, with much more in the app. this makes the rom one of the best for customization, so if you like to customize your rom to your liking and on android 10, then this would be the rom for you. Below is screen shot of the app.

Conclusion,<br>
Overall I think this is a really good rom for battery life power and customization, you have the customization application with tons of customizations options available to you, to your liking. Another thing I like about this rom is the battery life, you can get really good battery life if you manage they way you use your phone. This is one the best features I like about the rom, It is super optimized and Im currently waiting for it to become official. I haven't encountered any bugs so far which is a thumbs up from me. There are also some built-in features they have also built please give them a read on the xda link below so you can see what your getting into. one last note, this rom is superbly good if you know how to customize roms to your liking and you can use the features properly, then you will love the rom.

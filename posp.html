Welcome all to the review of Posp Rom.  This Rom Was tested by me. And it is running on Android 10. During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:
<ol class="pslist">
<li>Battery Life</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Benchmarking Score</li>
<li>Daily Experience</li>
<li>Features</li>
</ol>

Battery Life, <br>
I had used this rom for around 2 weeks and Battery life was average, I would get around 4hr to 5hr SOT but while the screen was off there was little to none battery drain, This makes it one of the best features of the rom. Here below you can screenshots of both battery usage and the SOT.

</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="Ps">
As you can see it shows a SOT of 5h 35m which is very good especially when using it all day without ever charing the device, It also shows the last time it was charged was 20 hours ago, This is remarkable that the device and the rom put together gives your strong idle time for a device which is over 2 years old now. So if your the type of person who uses there phone not as much and doesn't really play any games but mainly browsing such as reddit and instagram, this rom will be very good for you.

Performance,<br>
I had used this Rom for a 2 weeks and It was smooth and buttery smooth at times there were some stutter and lags when exiting an app. this was fixed when closing all apps from recent menu.
Surprisingly when taking a Geekbench 5 score, the scores were very good, The highest I have ever seen so far. below are the score I got.  
Performance with this rom is amazing, Its smooth and fluid with no bloatware. the rom claims to give you the best Performance and stability, and I think they have achieved their aim.

</ol>

<p class="Ps">
I ran a few games on this rom and all the games I ran fine with no lag or stutter, the games were Brawl stars, Clash of clans and PUBG with many more smaller titles.

UI, <br>
This rom was running on Android 9 and ONE UI version 1.5, there are a couple of customization features such as allowing the home screen and the app screen to go up to a 8x8 grid. this is useful if you want to have your icons small without using a launcher, there aren't much but thats because the whole point of the rom is to be as light and powerful as much as possible so you can great battery life. here is the full list of all the features you find in the rom.

Conclusion,<br>
Overall this is great rom for power and stability, This provides alot of battery life and Performance, Although not a ton of customization options but thats the price you must take if you want to have true power and battery life. this is the first version of the rom and the second release is due around july or september, hopefully we will see more changes then. as for bugs there aren't any I have encountered any, and VOLTE works this is a big thumbs up from me. Download this rom if you want true power, Performance and great battery life and you aren't too fussed about customization options not being available. Here is a link to the XDA page for the rom. this will give you all of the information on the rom, they also have a telegram channel for support.

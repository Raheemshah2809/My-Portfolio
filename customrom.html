Welcome all to my first Post, This Rom Was tested by me, During the testing phase I had conducted a few tests, These were:
<ol>
<li>Battery Life</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Benchmarking Score</li>
<li>Daily Experiance</li>
</ol>
<br>
Battery Life, <br>
I had used this Rom as my daily driver, this would mean I would be constanlyy on the phone

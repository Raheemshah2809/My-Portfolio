            <h3 class="abtitle">About the game</h3>
        This is a game I've been working on for a couple of weeks, The whole aim of the game is to show that I understand how to use loops and IF statements and other various skills when using java. 
        <br>
        <h4 class="smtitle">How does the game work</h4>
        <br>
        The game works by the user pressing on the roll dice button and this rolls the three dice and if any of the dice have a pair or a triple, the user will gain points, if there is no pair or triple then the user will have no points. At this point the game doesn't actually do much apart from this, this was me setting up the loops and assets to make sure that the dice roll and the user receive points. 
        <br>
        <h4 class="smtitle">Future Features</h4>
        <br>
        In the future the whole game mode will change, I will implement a guessing feature so the user has to guess what the three dice will output and if they get them right they will receive points based on if they have got 2 or 3 right, if they don't get any right then they lose points. I will also add a vibration pattern when the user guesses correctly, along with on screen animations and music.
